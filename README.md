My name is Leandro Assis, a brazilian engineer in love with all sorts of AI applications and Machine Learning.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Data Scientist, and I'm currently in the process of career migration to Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, ML, Statistics and SQL. For now, I'm focused on doing real life projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real life projects which require lots of machine learning resources!
