<a href="https://github.com/leassis91/hackday_ds/blob/master/bank-account-prediction-xgbclassifier-pipeline.ipynb">Hackday Competition - Classification Project</a>

**Project Description**: Amazing experience, my first live competition. The goal was to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals will and will not use a bank account. The models and solutions developed should provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/inclusao-financeira-na-africa/data). My team managed to end up in 3rd place.

<a href="https://github.com/leassis91/Portfolio/blob/main/Insights_Projects/Accidents/accidents.ipynb">Reducing Road High Fatality Accidents in UK - Exploratory Data Analysis Project</a>
    
**Project Description**: We work for the road safety team within the department of transport, and they are looking into how they can reduce the number of major incidents. The safety team classes major incidents as fatal accidents involving 3+ casualties. They are trying to learn more about the characteristics of these major incidents so they can brainstorm interventions that could lower the number of deaths. They have asked for our assistance with answering a number of questions.
