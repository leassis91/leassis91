<a href="https://github.com/leassis91/rossmann_store/">Rossmann Store Sale's Prediction - Regression Project</a>

**Project Description**: Since the recent results's accuracy are quite noisy, our work here is to give an assertive prediction of the sales of each store, up to 6 weeks in advance. This task has been assined to the whole team of Data Scientists, who are given a historical database in order to generate the desired forecasting. To catch up all details of the request, the team had a business meeting with company's CFO, who explained the need to establish a budget to carry out a general repair in each store.

<a href="https://github.com/leassis91/hackday_ds/">Hackday Competition - Classification Project</a>

**Project Description**: Amazing experience, my first live competition. The goal was to develop a machine learning model in order to predict whether users would have a bank account. The models and solutions designed should provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/inclusao-financeira-na-africa/data). My team managed to end up in 3rd place.

<a href="https://github.com/leassis91/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/Insights_Projects/HouseRocketEDA">House Rocket Company - Insights (EDA) Project</a>
    
**Project Description**: House Rocket's business model consists of purchasing and reselling properties through a digital platform. The data scientist is responsible for developing an online dashboard to help the CEO company overview properties available on House Rocket's portfolio and find the best business opportunities.

<a href="https://github.com/leassis91/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Insights_Projects/Accidents/">Reducing Road High Fatality Accidents in UK - Exploratory Data Analysis Project</a>
    
**Project Description**: We work for the road safety team within the department of transport, and they are looking into how they can reduce the number of major incidents. The safety team classes major incidents as fatal accidents involving 3+ casualties. They are trying to learn more about the characteristics of these major incidents so they can brainstorm interventions that could lower the number of deaths. They have asked for our assistance with answering a number of questions.

<a href="https://github.com/leassis91/Wine-Prediction-by-ML/blob/main/wine-classification-with-ml.ipynb">Wine Prediction - Classification Problem</a>
    
**Project Description**: My first Machine Learning project. Used a model that learned to classify wine in red or white based on its caracteristics from the dataset.
